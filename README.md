# Minesweeper
a simple minesweeper clone for the terminal, written in in c++

## Usage
 - Use the numbers on the left side of each option (i.e. 0 for 0. Quit)
 - To input what square you want to mine (equivalent to left-clicking), input the character for the row then the character for the column (i.e. 43 for the 4th row, 3rd column)
 - To input a flag, input an "f" before the position (i.e. f43)
 - To quit in the middle of a game input "q"
